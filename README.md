Public Catalog provides a mechanism for product metadata management, consumption, and publishing. Metadata provides important information about a product that is universal to all copies of that product, typically linked to a unique product identifier such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or Universal Product Code (UPC). For example, for a book, the metadata in question would include the title, author, publication year, cover image and perhaps details such as weight and dimension, linked to the ISBN of the book. Or, for electronics, the metadata could include product images, name, model year, manufacturer and feature set linked to the UPC.
