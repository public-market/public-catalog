#### An open metadata database designed to democratize access to product information that private marketplaces use to stifle competition.

**Public Market** is restoring the Commercial Commons by building 
an open, transparent, and competitive architecture 
for marketplace eCommerce.

**eCommerce Is Broken**

In less than two decades, a handful of private eCommerce platforms 
have grown to account for over half of online retail sales. 
The exorbitant fees and commissions they charge force sellers 
to drive up prices, ultimately hurting consumers.

**A Decentralized Alternative**

Weâ€™re leveraging blockchain technology to replace these closed, private, 
rent-extracting intermediaries with an open architecture and 
protocol for eCommerce. The Public Market protocol radically lowers costs for both buyers and sellers while requiring no tradeoffs with regards to convenience or risk.
